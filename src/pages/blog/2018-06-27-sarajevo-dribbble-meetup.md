Over 70 designers gathered under our roof to hear our lovely and talented UX designer **_Vildana Lojo_** talk about _"Creating Design Systems"_. **_Aleksandar Savić_** was the second speaker. The famous graphic designer and illustrator from Serbia spoke about _"Illustrations and portfolio building"_.

The attention audience paid to their presentations was incredible, and no wonder since both speakers have a rich and colorful industry background. They shared a lot of practical examples and interesting tips like “how to make a design system work even when you have a challenging client” or “how to get relevant audience and clients on dribbble and social media”. The whole event was very powerful, fun and pink. 



After the presentations, Vildana and Aleksandar challenged everyone to join in for some Analog Playoffs (Live sketching sessions). While the volunteers poured their talent and focus onto paper, the rest of us waited patiently over delicious snacks, talks and giggles.

When the time was up, we hung the designs on the wall for everyone to vote for their favorite piece of art by sticking a post-it onto it.

The winners earned a limited edition Dribbble Mistral T-shirt, while others got some other unique items. For all those who did not participate in this game, we made sure our FREE STUFF corner was packed with swag to take.



The main idea behind this meetup was to widen and strengthen the Sarajevo Designs Community and to open a design meetup season as a regular platform for experience sharing.



Due to many requests from our guests yesterday, we might organize the next one in the Fall. We will see and let you know in time. Until then, please contact us with any ideas and suggestions regarding design topics that you want to hear more about or even present.



 Big thanks to all who came and helped make this event the one to remember with a smile.
